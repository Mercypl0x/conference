biography: >-
  Attentive, passionate, devoted - even in early years, my fascination with
  technology made me want to dig deeper and find out what makes things work. As
  a curious traveller, the journey of continuous learning has led me to focus my
  energy on how to make software work intuitively for everyone, expressing my
  preference for functional user interfaces by emphasising careful design
  considerations and excessive testing.


  Facilitating meetings, coordinating tasks, and optimising processes excites
  me, while rapid advancements towards a common goal by excelling as a member of
  a well-managed, cooperative, and supportive team feels even more fulfilling. I
  have a strong appreciation towards structurally sound and well-organised
  projects. Being actively involved in planning is important to me, and I am
  always mindful about a colleague's efforts.


  My creativity is portrayed in written communication, descriptions, summaries,
  guides, stories, and the like. Gaining experience in programming over the past
  few years significantly fostered my aptitude for meticulous quality control;
  attention to detail has become second nature to me. I view a high level of
  perfection as key to customer satisfaction and therefore success. Doing things
  by halves displeases me - never settle for second best.
