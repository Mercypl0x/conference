title: Understanding Long-Term User Behaviour and Experiences
format: Paper
filetype: PDF
description: >-
  A diary study is a qualitative user research method used to collect insights
  about user behaviours, activities, and experiences over time and in context.


  During a diary study, participants report their interactions and experiences
  as they occur over a period ranging from a few days, weeks, to a month or
  longer.


  For example, in a diary study investigating how nurses interact with patient
  health records in a hospital setting, we may ask nurses to log all their
  activities involving health records.


  Collecting contextual, self-reported insights from participants over time
  makes diary studies great for understanding how users behave within the
  context of their everyday lives.
