  A diary study (commonly referred to as "camera study") involves a user keeping
  a diary documenting their usage. This kind of self-reporting is usually done
  over a period of multiple days or even weeks and repeated across different
  users.


  These entries provide estimates on time spent. The resulting data may be
  statistically analysed.
